    - (Mike Schilli) Added optional replacement function to find(). Now you 
      can not only replace URLs found, but also the rest of the text around
      them in one fell swoop.

0.16 Fri Jul 22 06:00:24 EDT 2005
    - Oops, make the URI::Find::Schemeless->top_level_domain_re case
      insensitive, as it should be and the docs claimed it was.  Thanks
      to Todd Eigenschink.

0.15 Tue Mar 22 07:23:17 EST 2005
    - Have all functions croak if invoked with the wrong number of
      arguments.  Add URI::Find->badinvo.

    - Mention DARREN's urifind script in the man page.
    - Oops, URI::URL::strict was turned on and left on.  Put it back the
      way you found it.  Thanks to Chris Nandor.

    - Schemeless.pm:
        - Find '<x>intag.com</x>'.
        - Get $tldRe from a new class method, ->top_level_domain_re.
        - Update top level domain list.

0.13 Sat Oct  9 08:20:04 EDT 2004
    - Add copyright notice.
    - Add ] to main $cruftSet, } to schemeless $cruftSet, for
      [http://square.com] and {brace.com}.
    - quotemeta() $cruftSet.

0.13 Mon Jul  1 10:37:54 EDT 2002
    - Don't find any schemeless URIs with a plain URI::Find.  Previously
      it'd find ones which started with "ftp." and "www.", but it was
      more prone to false positives than URI::Find::Schemeless.
    - Have schemeless_to_schemed use http:// except in the specific case
      in which it uses ftp://.  Remove URI::Find::Schemeless's version.

0.12 Wed Mar 20 14:39:21 EST 2002
    - Improve the "wrap each URI found in an HTML anchor" example.
    - Release a new version so CPAN sees the maintainer change.

0.11 Thu Jul 26 14:43:49 EDT 2001
    - Michael passed the module to Roderick for maintenance.
    - Improve test suite.
    - Tweak URI::Find::Schemeless not to find Foo.p[ml].

0.10  Mon Jul 10 20:14:08 EDT 2000
    - Rearchitected the internals to allow simple subclassing
    - Added URI::Find::Schemeless (thanks Roderick)

0.04  Sat Feb 26 09:05:11 GMT 2000
    - Added # to the uric set of characters so HTML anchors are caught.

0.03  Tue Feb  1 16:15:22 EST 2000
    - Added some heuristic discussion to the docs.
    - Added some heuristics to avoid picking up perl module names
    - Improved schemeless URI heuristic to avoid picking up
      usenet board names.
    - Handling the <URL:...> case better as suggested in RFC 2396 Apdx E
    - Added ; to the cruft heuristic

0.02  Tue Feb  1 13:11:56 EST 2000
    - Added heuristic to handle 'URL:http://www.foo.com'
    - Added heuristic to handle trailing quotes.
